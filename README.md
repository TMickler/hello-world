# hello-world
First program in a few years...

I'm pursuing a job that will put me a little bit out of my wheelhouse for a while -- it requires familiarity with programming concepts (specifically for vehicle automation applications to heavy construction industries).

I believe the major language of that space is C++, so I'm familiarizing myself with it as well as with Linux distros and version control. These are all things I've had some exposure to in the past, but I need to brush up.
